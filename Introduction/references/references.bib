In this paper, an artificial neural network (ANN) combined with the Green's function is applied to construct a mapping relationship between the magnitude of the radiation field from an unknown EM source and the observation point. The ANN is trained by using the scanned near-field magnitude from the unknown EM source. The strong nonlinearity ability of the ANN makes the field prediction of the device under test (DUT) possess high accuracy, even if there is strong electromagnetic reflections around the DUT. Both numerical and measurement experiments are carried out to verify the effectiveness of this method. The proposed method provides a new solution for electromagnetic interference modelling in complex electromagnetic environments.},

  abstract = {Abstract After smoking, exposure to radon and its progeny is the second leading cause of lung cancer. The probability of inducing lung carcinomas by inhaled radon progeny depends on the deposited radiation dose, and is significantly affected by physiological and morphometric changes induced by smoking. Due to irritation of the airways, the inhalation of cigarette smoke leads to the hyperproduction of mucus. Two concurrent processes occur: on one hand, increased production of mucus protects the target cells against radiation damage; on the other hand, in the case of long-term smokers, a chronic lung obstruction develops, causing an increase in the radiation dose to the lungs. Depending on the duration and intensity of smoking, these processes contribute to the final radiation dose with different weights. The primary objective of this study was to investigate to what extent these smoke-induced changes can modify the resulting absorbed dose of inhaled radon progeny relative to healthy nonsmokers. Since the bronchial dose depends on the degree of lung tissue damage, we have used this dose as a tool for detecting the effects of smoking on the lung epithelium. In other words, the biological effect of radon served as a tracer of changes induced by smoking.},

Lifetime risk of lung cancer calculated using data for several miner cohorts were 2.4 – 7.5 x 10-4 per Working Level Month (WLM) of radon-222 progeny exposure for a mixed male / female population and 3.0 – 9.6 x 10-4 per WLM for a male population. Dosimetric models gave mean values of effective dose coefficients from radon-222 progeny of 12 mSv per WLM for mines, 16 mSv per WLM for indoor workplaces and 11 mSv per WLM for homes. The lifetime risk coefficient used by the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) is 5 x 10-4 per WLM and it has recently recommended an effective dose coefficient for radon-222 and progeny of 3 mSv per mJ h m-3 (about 10 mSv per WLM) for most circumstances of exposure. The ICRP risk and dose coefficients are supported by the UNSCEAR review and provide a clear and firm basis for current international advice and standards for protection from radon. UNSCEAR will continue to use a lower value of effective dose coefficient of 5.7 mSv per WLM for assessments of population exposures.}

In the past, dose estimation methods include the deterministic and stochastic methods, which have some defects that polarize the computation overhead or accuracy. To address this, we proposed the Monte Carlo–point kernel (MC-PK) coupling method. This paper establishes a nuclear power plant model and uses the nuclear reactor's available power operation history to calculate device source data. For comparison, the radiation field has been calculated using both the Monte Carlo method and the MC-PK coupling method. The comparison result demonstrates that the MC-PK coupling method's calculation time is much less than that for the Monte Carlo method and the mean absolute percentage error of MC-PK relative to MCM is 24.92%. This study provides a viable strategy for the real-time radiation field calculation of decommissioning nuclear facilities.}

In the grid space, the missing data of grid line is filled by means of constructing function. Then, the value of grid interior points is obtained by use of the net function interpolation method. To demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method, the simulation experiment concerning a single point source is carried out. Compared with the simulation results of Monte Carlo method, the calculation results perform well. To make the simulation environment real, another experiment with multiple volumetric sources is done. The inversion results are also satisfactory. What's more, as the sampling data increases, the degree of reduction is further improved. It is worthwhile mentioning that the results have relative errors of 1.91%, 5.47% and 1.22% respectively. In this paper, the radiation field is restored very well according to the sparse sampling data. Hence, the proposed method is a quite effective way for the inversion of nuclear radiation field.}

The CHAVIR software allows the operators to prepare (and repeat) all the operations they would have to do in a safe virtual world, before performing the actual work inside the facilities. Since the decommissioning or maintenance work is carried out in an environment where there is radiation, the amount of radiation that the operator would be exposed to is calculated and integrated into the simulator.

  abstract       = {Radiation mapping, through the detection of ionising gamma-ray emissions, is an important technique used across the nuclear industry to characterise environments over a range of length scales. In complex scenarios, the precise localisation and activity of radiological sources becomes difficult to determine due to the inability to directly image gamma photon emissions. This is a result of the potentially unknown number of sources combined with uncertainties associated with the source-detector separation&mdash;causing an apparent &lsquo;blurring&rsquo; of the as-detected radiation field relative to the true distribution. Accurate delimitation of distinct sources is important for decommissioning, waste processing, and homeland security. Therefore, methods for estimating the precise, &lsquo;true&rsquo; solution from radiation mapping measurements are required. Herein is presented a computational method of enhanced radiological source localisation from scanning survey measurements conducted with a robotic arm. The procedure uses an experimentally derived Detector Response Function (DRF) to perform a randomised-Kaczmarz deconvolution from robotically acquired radiation field measurements. The performance of the process is assessed on radiation maps obtained from a series of emulated waste processing scenarios. The results demonstrate a Projective Linear Reconstruction (PLR) algorithm can successfully locate a series of point sources to within 2 cm of the true locations, corresponding to resolution enhancements of between 5&times; and 10&times;.},
