  abstract  = {Unintended electromagnetic (EM) radiation source may cause device failure in high-speed circuits. In this paper, an artificial neural network (ANN) combined with the Green's function is applied to construct a mapping relationship between the magnitude of the radiation field from an unknown EM source and the observation point. The ANN is trained by using the scanned near-field magnitude from the unknown EM source. The strong nonlinearity ability of the ANN makes the field prediction of the device under test (DUT) possess high accuracy, even if there is strong electromagnetic reflections around the DUT. Both numerical and measurement experiments are carried out to verify the effectiveness of this method. The proposed method provides a new solution for electromagnetic interference modelling in complex electromagnetic environments.},

  abstract = {Abstract After smoking, exposure to radon and its progeny is the second leading cause of lung cancer. The probability of inducing lung carcinomas by inhaled radon progeny depends on the deposited radiation dose, and is significantly affected by physiological and morphometric changes induced by smoking. Due to irritation of the airways, the inhalation of cigarette smoke leads to the hyperproduction of mucus. Two concurrent processes occur: on one hand, increased production of mucus protects the target cells against radiation damage; on the other hand, in the case of long-term smokers, a chronic lung obstruction develops, causing an increase in the radiation dose to the lungs. Depending on the duration and intensity of smoking, these processes contribute to the final radiation dose with different weights. The primary objective of this study was to investigate to what extent these smoke-induced changes can modify the resulting absorbed dose of inhaled radon progeny relative to healthy nonsmokers. Since the bronchial dose depends on the degree of lung tissue damage, we have used this dose as a tool for detecting the effects of smoking on the lung epithelium. In other words, the biological effect of radon served as a tracer of changes induced by smoking.},

  abstract = {The United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR) has provided a detailed and authoritative update of its reviews of the epidemiology and dosimetry of radon and progeny. Lifetime risk of lung cancer calculated using data for several miner cohorts were 2.4 – 7.5 x 10-4 per Working Level Month (WLM) of radon-222 progeny exposure for a mixed male / female population and 3.0 – 9.6 x 10-4 per WLM for a male population. Dosimetric models gave mean values of effective dose coefficients from radon-222 progeny of 12 mSv per WLM for mines, 16 mSv per WLM for indoor workplaces and 11 mSv per WLM for homes. The lifetime risk coefficient used by the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) is 5 x 10-4 per WLM and it has recently recommended an effective dose coefficient for radon-222 and progeny of 3 mSv per mJ h m-3 (about 10 mSv per WLM) for most circumstances of exposure. The ICRP risk and dose coefficients are supported by the UNSCEAR review and provide a clear and firm basis for current international advice and standards for protection from radon. UNSCEAR will continue to use a lower value of effective dose coefficient of 5.7 mSv per WLM for assessments of population exposures.}
